We add [[https://clickhouse.yandex/][ClickHouse]] as a new product type to the builtin [[http://repo.or.cz/w/emacs.git/blob/HEAD:/lisp/progmodes/sql.el][sql-mode]] in Emacs. That
way, we get syntax highlighting and can communicate with the DB using the CLI
=clickhouse-client=.

Note that the client assumes being run in a fully-functional terminal. While
running a query, it will print updated statistics every 100ms. Inside Emacs,
with the =comint= interface, these messages accumulate rather than update in
place, which is kind of messy (including some coloring). I failed to disable
this behavior so far, but there is a parameter to control the frequency of these
updates in microseconds. I use the following query to increase it to 10 seconds:

#+BEGIN_SRC
-- 10 seconds in microseconds
SET interactive_delay = 10000000;
#+END_SRC
